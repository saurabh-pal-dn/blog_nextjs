The day of 4th May 2023 was the first time I sat amongst the people who I had only seen in Newspapers. The prominent dignitaries that deigned their presence included names like **H. Krishnamurthy**, **K. Nikhila**, and **Shailendra Trivedi**. These individuals carry the pedigree of renowned institutions as well as great authority and experience. Sitting amongst them I felt like a child amidst men.

The group was convened to discuss the matter of private cloud augmentation. This cloud is responsible for handling the non-payments application of RBI which range from the websites to critical internal tools. The discussion started with a light note of introduction and warm greetings followed by a thorough explanation of technical requirement analysis. A few of them are as follows:

1. Over 60% avg. CPU utilization, ~85% peak CPU utilization
2. Storage solutions running out
3. Servers going out of service in 2025
4. Extra servers needed for more intensive projects
5. Associated virtualization licenses

The whole system is based on complete virtualization ranging from the application servers to the storage SDS. Thus the addition of new servers will also require cluster reorganization and interoperability with existing infrastructure.

The whole project costs above 175 Crore, thus it was only natural for the committee to discuss the necessity for such solutions. there were instances where the committee felt the need to shell out the money is justified, for eg. in terms of storage, an inexpensive Virtual Tape Library was suggested. The committee acknowledged that VTL is an appropriate solution for ensuring data redundancy and providing for the large volume backup requirements of the Bank, given that the need for data retrieval is minimal for the Bank.

```bash
Hence, the Bank made a conscious decision to go for the aforementioned solution.
```

Pay close attention to the words, each word holds significance and weight.

Numerous discussions were held to understand the procurement process, a few salient points are:

1. Incorporation of 2 solutions in a single order to encourage maximum bidder participation and reduction in bureaucratic overhead.
2. Cost-Based Selection Methodology
3. Addition of SLA and liquidated damages be made part of the agreement.
4. Freedom to increase/decrease the number of resources for Facility Management
5. Extensive market research to ensure appropriate participation.

based on the inputs from all team members, the committee finalized the approach for procurement, eligibility criteria, and evaluation methodology. Post concensus the committee adjourned for the day. The technical discussions and insights provided by the committee members were insightful and certain members provided domain knowledge like data center augmentation best practices to ensure minimal downtime. Expert knowledge was also provided for vendor negotiation and price discovery.

In my personal opinion, the whole exercise was informative and an excellent way to learn how big projects are ideated, consolidated, and implemented to finalize a single goal. I wish to be part of more such discussions. The task of creating _Minutes of Metting_ is a chore though ðŸ˜›.
