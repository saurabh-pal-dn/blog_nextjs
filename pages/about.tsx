      <p>
        Hey! I&apos;m a software developer working in RBI as a manager. I have
        deep interest in Finance and technology and working towards being a
        rockstar in the Fin-Tech domain. In my free time I watch documentaries
        and read history. You can read about it in Pop Culture
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is a collection of what I have learned in terms of technology
        and work experiences. My personal projects can be found on my github. Go
        have a look.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m planning on updating this blog as much as possible but
        can&apos;t promise anything ðŸ˜›.
