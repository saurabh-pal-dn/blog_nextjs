## Why do we need locking in the first place?

Let's suppose you have 2 clients making requests to a single resource and we want to avoid any race conditions from happening. As an example, let’s consider 2 users (A and B) who want to read and update a variable by 1. If both of them access the variable at the same time, they will update the value simultaneously leading to a race condition. We need to impose locking to prevent the data from being corrupted.

## Why 2PL?

We have the option to use serializable isolation to prevent race conditions (RC). Serialization basically means every instruction is carried one after another. Another way to express this is, that all the instructions can be run parallelly and the end result would be same, as they are non-conflicting. This causes the DB to acquire lock on each resource and not release it unless all the operations on it are committed. This leads to loss of concurrency and high latency. A single high-demanding task can pause the remaining operations for a long time.
Now let's consider 2PL

First some definitions:

1. Shared lock: Multiple clients can acquire a shared lock to read, if an update is required they must wait for the shared lock to be released
2. Exclusive lock: A single client must acquire an exclusive lock to update the value. Any read must wait for the exclusive lock to be released

Now that we have the basics covered, let's define 2PL

If a transaction wants to read an object, it must first acquire the lock in shared mode. Several transactions are allowed to hold the lock in shared mode simultaneously, but if another transaction already has an exclusive lock on the object, the transaction must wait.

If a transaction wants to write to an object, it must first acquire the lock in exclusive mode. No other transaction may hold the lock at the same time (neither in shared nor in exclusive mode), so if there is any existing lock on the object, the transaction must wait.

If a transaction first reads and then writes an object, it may upgrade its shared lock to an exclusive lock. The upgrade works the same as getting an exclusive lock directly

After a transaction has acquired the lock, it must continue to hold the lock until the end of the transaction

The 2 phases are when the locks are acquired and the second phase is when the locks are released.

## Challenges

1. Traditional DBs don’t possess a time limit for a transaction, if one transaction has to wait for another, long queues may be formed that have to wait for several others to complete before processing.
2. Deadlocks can happen. Though DBs generally resolve DBs automatically, but any transaction terminated has to abort all its work, which is retired. If deadlocks are frequent, that results in lots of wasted work.

## A better solution?

Worry not, we have a better solution at hand(at least for some cases). We may describe 2PL as Pessimistic concurrency control, and serializable locking takes this to the extreme. We can opt for optimistic concurrency control in the form of serializable snapshot isolation. We allow transactions to happen anyway in the hope that everything will turn out okay. We a transaction wants to commit the DB checks whether isolation is violated, if yes the transaction is aborted and retried.

It performs badly if there is high contention, this leads to a high proportion of transactions needing to abort.
