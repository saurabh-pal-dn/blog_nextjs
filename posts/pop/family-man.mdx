On the prolific premise of an impulsive spy risking it all on the faith that is held by a thread, this TV show delivers more than it was anticipated. The loose fragments that make up the story are not compelling as we are accustomed to or even numbed by the senseless destruction and frequently convoluted plots that plague modern media. But Family Man shines with its gripping narrative, powerful performance( looking at you Manoj Vajpayee) and dialogues that make you curse at the antagonists. The simple introduction of news-inspired stories to create an innocent distraction for our smart detectives was a brilliant move on the director's part.

The inconsistencies in police work, their mistakes, the problems faced by our task force and their _jugad_ remedies aren't just funny but comical. Now coming to the star of the show: Manoj. Portraying the character of an operative, he is struggling to juggle family life and an ever-demanding job. At home, he is viewed as a loser and trod-beaten, self-pity, conserved individual who doesn't disclose his desires and failures to his own wife because duty stands in the way(ah patriotism). At the office, he is the all-knowing, Casanova who has a sixth sense to anticipate disaster moments before it strikes, but the disaster still strikes, leaving him only to yarn together an implausible story from fragmented information. Occasional impulsive reactions from him yield results but only after he has deteriorated the situation to the point that drastic measures are the only way out. It must have broken Manoj's back to carry the whole show on his shoulders (and charms).

The premise to have a nerve gas attack in New Delhi, killing hundreds and forcing India's hand into war is a vague and unclear strategy for a coup. but this did not stop me from liking it as it averts the status quo and introduces refreshing change. It is obvious they won't be able to execute it as this is an Indian drama, which due to my prejudice, undermines it in my eyes.

The finale disappoints with a cliche happy ending.
