Not many T.V. series are good, even fewer are great and in this era of mass media entertainment, one can easily forget the importance and moral lesson a show, its characters and the theme can offer to the audience. Cobra Kai is a show not about karate, rivalry, ambitions, and failures but it is a show that portrays the vice of everyday life. It offers a gripping story, intertwined with wholesome characters, but the real star of the show is the understanding/advice one receives from it. This is an honest critical analysis of the show and lets me tell you, I don't do critical essays much, but the sweet innocence, love and warmth wrapped in a shroud that Cobra Kai offers( without ever feeling to be campy or corny) has compelled me to undertake this audacious task.

The cinematography is on point. The series never undertakes itself as an overambitious project that tries to overwhelm the audience with complex cinematography and lens work. The director kept the style and technique very simple which suits the demography of the target audience. This simplistic yet effective approach makes watching it a delight. Another noteworthy addition is the use of karate as a tool of entertainment. It is a well-established fact that karate is thrilling, but it has been so repeatedly copied and rehashed that it is not fun anymore. The sudden outbreak from gravity-defying kicks to realistic action is a pleasant one. The choreography is remarkable, it puts in a lot of effort to make the motion seem legitimate and the impact is not only seen but also felt. Combining the 2 main aspects: cinematography and choreography director has succeeded in delivering the thrill to the likes of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.

Casting is the one place where the series has suffered a little slack. The actors are remarkable, but on an occasion or two, one tends to feel a bit of uneasiness in accepting the true nature of the character which can be attributed to the (or lack of) acting skills. The protagonist Mr Diaz is good, his sensei John is just great. The wide range of emotions and scenarios are rendered beautifully by him, and the arc of self-pity, then his self-upliftment is portrayed amazingly. One feels his pain and grows sympathy for the guy.

The story is the part where Cobra Kai serves the purpose of inducing morale in the young audience. "Fight won't come by waiting for pleasant weather and breeze" and the series does justice by striking the message home. Let's dwell deep into the story. The story of rivalry, it was all for a girl (yes, it's a cliched movie plot) and what follows defines the life of 2 individuals. This is where the series differentiates itself from the reel world and enters the real world. depiction of both sides of the coin conveys the ideology that not everything in this world is black and white, and more often than not it is grey. Larusso was right but he was also wrong, and so was Johnny, be it because of the influence of his master or his own insecurities. Both have their fair share of vices and they try to make the best. The same is the case with Diaz and Robby, they imitate the conflict of their sensei, but instead of the conflict being an outcome of their own doing it was circumstances that pushed them to opposite ends. The clever use of circumstances to introduce confrontations and keep the audience on the edge of their seats (ðŸ˜Š), nice work. This rivalry trickles down to the two-female protagonist. One exuberating confidence and power while the other is the counterpart: calm and composed but ready to retaliate. They both serve a lot more than love interests, caring the story forward and providing the moral underrating of not rooting for the character but for the right deed instead. Apart from the comedy, use of references and an altogether funny enterprise, one finds it easy to forget the underlying message of righteousness and courage and honour. These messages are so subtle (sometimes not so) that it takes areal effort to derive meaning from the character interaction on the screen. The depiction of Diaz's failure after undertaking the lesson of mercy and honour concurs with real life, so what should one do? Suffer at the hands of injustice or be unjust and even the odds?

This tv series is truly remarkable and it is refreshing to see something of caliber rise amidst a sea of garbage and mediocracy. I can't wait for the next season and the other convoluted encounters that fill up every episode.
