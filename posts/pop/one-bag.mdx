> _A man is rich in proportions to the things he can live without - Henry D. Thoreau_ <br/>

Capitalism has created a class of people who possess more than they need and expend more than they mean. The major downside amongst others, is that there is no limit to this. Just one more sofa, one more drape, and one more duvet are the most blatant lies we tell ourselves. What if we flip the question on its head and ask what is the minimum one needs to live comfortably with a decent quality of life? The best part is, that there is a limit, and it is reached surprisingly soon. If we sit and ponder the amenities and goods to achieve this, the brevity of the list is remarkable.  
The exuberance of life stems from a light mind, body and soul and a light backpack would be a step in that direction. The idea is to travel for a week with a backpack of around 50 liters. What are the necessities for running your life at a comfortable level?
Here is my list:
1. Wear
> a. 3 Casual T-Shirts <br/>
> b. 2 Shirts (1 Party / 1 Formal) <br/>
> c. 2 Jeans, 2 Pants and 1 Chinos <br/>
> d. 2 Gym Shorts <br/>
> e. 2 Activewear T-shirts <br/>
> f. 1 Sports shoes <br/>
> g. 1 Flipflops <br/>
> h. Travel Under Garments <br/>
> i. Sunglasses <br/>
> j. 4 pairs of contact lenses <br/>
> k. Watch (black) <br/>
> l. 3 Pair of socks and a belt <br/>
2. Electronics
> a. Mobile phone (great camera) <br/>
> b. Laptop <br/>
> c. Charger (Type-C cable included) <br/>
> d. Earbuds <br/>
> e. Kindle with 5 books <br/>
3. Wallet
> a. 2 Credit cards <br/>
> b. 1 debit card <br/>
> c. Personal identification (Aadhar, PAN, DL, etc.) <br/>
> d. Passport size photo (address written on the back) <br/>
4. Toiletries
> a. Sunscreen <br/>
> b. Moisturizer (face and body separate) <br/>
> c. Soap/Bodywash <br/>
> d. Loofah <br/>
> e. Razor <br/>
> f. Toothbrush & tongue cleaner <br/>
5. Miscellaneous
> a. 1 book <br/>

These would be sufficient for me to have a decent level of comfort and go hand in hand with the ideals of minimalism. The idea is not to throw away or replace stuff that you enjoy, rather I aim to cultivate the practice of replacing the stuff that does not matter while prioritizing high-utility and high-quality products.
The world is a book and those who don't travel read only a single page. Travel well and travel light.
