## F1 the Movie

"F1 the Movie" is the recent instalment by *Joseph Kosinski*, if that name rings a bell, it is because he is the brain behind [Top Gun - Maverick](/posts/pop/top-gun-maverick). And while enjoying this movie, it will be evident that we are witnessing an old legend, fighting a new wave of talent, mentoring new blood and seizing the moment in the end. However, instead of doing it in a fighter jet (like in 2022), we are in a car (albeit a very fast one).


### Simply lovely

**Simply Lovely**: A single word to describe the cinematic experience, that brings the vision of the director to a visually stunning complemented by amazing camera work. The film is an embodiment of the sport: Big, Noisy, Gritty and spectacular. 
A big gripe of showing cars as sluggish (through the official race coverage) has been addressed in the movie, and the cars actually appear to be driven at 200+ mph. The movie utilised custom-made camera systems, the Rialto and the even smaller [Rialto Mini](https://www.fdtimes.com/2025/03/26/sony-rialto-mini/), to allow for shooting in tight spaces like cockpits while actors were driving. The lack of green screen, instead utilisation of real f2 cars brings the viewer an immersive experience. 

An intergenerational rift between our protagonist, Sonny and the rookie, Joshua, is a tested formula used by screenwriters to explain the intricacies of the sport is an old yet effective practice. We are expositioned technical jargon, car terms, etc., yet it is neither boring nor overwhelming, which keeps this behemoth (read long) movie entertaining and fresh.  


The music score by Hans Zimmer is a hit and a miss. The tracks have favourites which bring the F1 races alive yet, the music editing in emotional scenes downplays the intensity and edges on the border of cringe/corny. However, I appreciate its "big and loud" nature and its return to a '90s blockbuster vibe.

**Kerry Condon** performance is excellent, sometimes even too good for an action flick. **Brad Pitt** shines and potrays as the most of himself, cocky, arrogant, humane, athletic, charming (no one trait in particular yet jack of all). **Javier Bardem** exists. I forgot the third guy.


### Lack of the spirit

*F1* attempts to replicate the success of *Top Gun* by using similar camera angles, themes, and a mentor-mentee dynamic; however, it falls short in multiple areas:
1. The stakes in Top Gun felt higher (it's a life-or-death situation), whereas accidents in F1 lack consequences and resolve quickly. 
2. The predecessor paid more attention to the precision required by its pilots, which is less emphasised for F1 drivers in this film. Fans expecting a deep dive in the technicalities like transmission, combustion thermodynamics, etc. will be brushed aside with a wind tunnel, a few colourful simulation and "we need to chase them on the corners" bullshit.
3. A personal pick is the use of reaction shots to convey the effort involved in racing; however, it distracts from the race itself.
4. I wished for more moments that focus purely on the experience of driving, devoid of commentary, engine sounds and background scores; just pure bliss and the experience of driving, the machine and the man. This is seen in the last few minutes of the movie, where driving is described as flying for Sonny, and we see spectacular tracking shots accompanied by fireworks; a visual surreal delight.
5. Addition of unnecessary love story that served no other purpose apart from highlighting Brad's dimples and extending the runtime by 20 minutes (I ain't complaining for the former).


### Technical fallacies

The movie glosses over a mountain of technical details, commits multiple blunders and appears confused with the narrative. As a F1 fan who follows the sport, I was expecting either the movie to appeal to the masses or be a tribute to the sport, yet it turned out to be an expensive PR for an exclusive sport about which half of the world already knows.

From a fan's perspective, the film tries to showcase real cars, real race tracks, real team principals, and real drivers (Max, Carlos, Toto, Perez, Lewis) to immerse the viewer in the narration. The camera pans with the cars, follows them, leaving a true sense of speed. The technicalities are mentioned, strategies are discussed, designs are made, and corporate espionage is executed. Observe how quickly multiple liberties are taken to keep the movie engaging. Alternatively, the movie displays unrealistic scenarios like no wins in 9 races (and earlier 2 seasons), DNF in the whole season, Sonny not bending the rules but snapping them in half! These juxtapositions in the same movie create a visceral, vexing experience, leaving questions once out of the theatre. For e.g., how was Sonny allowed to run in the Abu Dhabi race while not racing in the qualifying? Additionally, the writing is superficial, an unnecessary love story, a lack of motivation for our protagonist, a flair of disbelief, bundled into a second and third act. No discussion of engine mechanics, team rivalries, and other crucial aspects, however, the movie tries to justify it as *it's just noise*. 

### Conclusion 
Despite its technical prowess, F1 struggles to match *Maverick's* intensity, with less emphasis on the high stakes and precision of the sport. While it falls short in a few key areas, I ultimately enjoyed F1, appreciating it for its big and loud '90s blockbuster feel and charmingly cheesy elements. Simple and lovely (for the masses).
