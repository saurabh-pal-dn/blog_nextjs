### Introduction
Dune is a global phenomenon; everyone not living under a rock has seen Timothy and the vast expanse of the Dune desert. This is not a review of the movie; it encompasses a critical analysis of the sublime themes that are propagated in the movie as the path taken by a prophet (false prophet) to liberation. I have adopted a candid approach to the above-mentioned subjects that subjugate the depiction of liberation and morality into an authoritative and fanatic idealogy fabricated through eons of coercion and religious deceit.

### False Prophet
Paul Artedis is a false prophet. Paul was never Kwisatz Haderach. He was destined to fail like Duke Leto. When placed in the middle of a war-enraged, harsh planet with multiple assassination attempts and a coming conflict with Harkonnen, he opportunistically grasped what he could. The Bene Gesserit had fostered a prophecy of Lisan-al-Gaib (voice from the outer world) that would lead the freemen to the path of redemption and rebuild Arrakis in the image of paradise. The faith of the prophecy, recursively cemented through ideas, stories and religious fervor had cultivated a ripe field of exploitation for Paul. 

Chani's confrontation with the relentless and blind faith towards Lisan-al-Gaib in the movie was a refreshing change from the books. However, her voice of reason is subdued when Paul himself asserts the prophecy in the meeting with the elder tribesmen in the South. He reiterates the prophecy in the minds of the freemen that he is the Messiah, whereas we have just observed him discarding that title a few scenes ago. I believe this at this juncture, Paul diverts from the archetype protagonist from a figure of morality and reason to a corrupt, tyrannical fanatic, vying for revenge. 

Paul doesn't prioritize his moral betterment or the liberation of freemen instead he yearns for the utilitarian objective of murdering his enemies and consolidating his position through the unwavering faith of the freemen. This is evident from the way Paul's character dictates his first command after ascending to the throne of Arrakis. The Great Houses refused to honor his ascendancy, to which he replied: 
> _Lead them to Paradise_

The choice of words is the same as the description of Lisan-al-Gaib.
> the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> will change the face of Arrakis.
> He will bring back the trees.
> He will bring back... a Green Paradise.

The repetition reinforces the religious idealogy of massacre and destruction cloaked as the redemption and salvation of the oppressed from the tyranny of exploitation and servitude. Paul Atreides is not Messiah, he is human and prone to err.

### Religion and Conflict
A multitude of literature and academic studies have demonstrated a recurring theme **War increases religiosity**. The conformity instilled through [communes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commune) is instrumental in the survival of a culture. The research done on the subject of [Longevity of commune](http://cognitionandculture.net/wp-content/uploads/Sosis_2003_CommuneLongevity.pdf) suggests that commune that is supported by religious beliefs are more pervasive durable, and stable than secular beliefs. The beliefs based on religion are irrefutable and past the spirit of scrutiny. Ultimate beliefs are unverifiable and hence potentially eternally true. Such beliefs demand sacrifice which is portrayed in the movie through the sacred reservoirs that contain water from the dead freemen and no freemen will take from them even in the face of death. Such sacrifice postulates are not subject to the vicissitudes of examination they are beyond examination making them much stabler reference than those employed by secular rituals.

We may also consider that individuals affected by conflict tend towards religion for guidance and shelter. The religious institutions or ideologies resonate with the innate faith of such individuals who look for redemption through armed conflicts that may result in feedback loops that may worsen the conflict and change the course of the religious identity. This is analogous to freemen *avant-garde* following Paul to space Jihad in the name of Paradise. 

There are multiple researches supporting the above-mentioned postulates, but the majority of such studies are only three decades old. We ought to remember that Dune was published in 1965, hence Frank Herbert, who was a formidable journalist, had an innate understanding of human interactions, societies and religious identities and their collective influence on communities. He was a pioneer.

### The Golden Path 
Paul and then later his son Leto II follow the golden path to save the human race from extinction, yet they crush the universe for thousands of years, forcing humanity to learn a lesson etched into their very being. The path to redemption originates from the very destruction of itself. In my view, these are ideas that we see and experience in today's world. The war and proliferation of religious fervor in the name of redemption are widespread and take all means necessary to subjugate the masses to their ideologies.

I also want to point out that Dune is not a story about good vs bad. It's a story of political, ideological, and religious intrigue that doesn't consider itself with the morality of one's action. Morality is subsided for purpose, survival and rationale. It makes the protagonist human, not devoid of flaws.
